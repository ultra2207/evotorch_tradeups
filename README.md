A program to find profitable cs2 tradeups using genetic algorithm based on evotorch. Enables u to skip the terrible buy order strat and directly
find listed profitable combos using evolutionery algorithm. Refer to control flow doc and documentation. Currently not very profitable due to
existing bots and market saturation. It shows an application of meta heuristic optimization algorithms in unique real world scenarios.

I have made this public and if u wish to use this in your own bots u can do so, if u want to contribute open a pull request and if u want to ask me something, open an issue. All tradeups are currently found through intuition, so I'm happy to have made one that uses computer science optimization algorithms to find tradeups using items that are listed on the steam market, which is not possible using manual methods due to the rarity of such combos. This computer science method beats all current methods to find tradeups, showing the power of efficient large scale data processing.

Immense data has to be collected so consider using mullvad instead of the free proxies. This genetic algortihm is the most cutting edge meta huerisitc algorithm that can be applied for such a massive real world combinatorial search spaces and evotorch library allows it to be further accelerated.

Note:
Code has reached a working V0.1 state however the quantity of unique tradeups and the profitablity of each tradeup and 7 day hold along with difficulty of obtaining items for the profitable combos (hard to snipe good quantity steam market and abysmal rates for buy orders) means that it is just not very profitable in raw terms. Could be run with lower generations and can be made faster.

Documentation beyond control flow is not extensive as project has been shelved and is not in full deployment due to low profit. Can be built upon further with aiosteampy to automatically buy the found tradeups and node-steam-user to automatically do the tradeups. The 7 day trade hold makes it pointless as u will have to wait 7 days to list the outputs anyway and therefore further automation is unnecessary.
